                        <li><strong>Push Notifications.</strong> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>

                    <h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We process the personal information for the following purposes listed below. We may also process your information for other purposes only with your prior explicit consent.</p>

                    <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

                    <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>

                    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>

                    <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

                    <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
                        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                        <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
                        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                        <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                        <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
                        <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
                        <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
                        <li>We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>

                    <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We share personal information with third-party service providers for operational purposes, such as Google Firebase for authentication, secure storage of photos/captions, and database management. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and do not use it for their own purposes beyond providing services to us. We do not sell or share your data for advertising or marketing.</p>

                    <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. Geolocation data is retained for 6 months after account deletion to comply with legal backups.</p>

                    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                    <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

                    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process, including encryption for data at rest and in transit via Firebase. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

                    <h2>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>

                    <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

                    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                    <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below or updating your preferences.</p>

                    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

                    <h2>8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>

                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Our Services are not directed at children under the age of 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions).</p>

                    <p>Park Memories is intended for family use but not specifically for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and applicable laws. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete it promptly. Parents can contact us at privacy@edentv.us to review or delete their child's data. COPPA requires operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 to provide notice and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children.</p>

                    <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

                    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

                    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time. California has enacted laws requiring recognition of opt-out preference signals like GPC (Global Privacy Control), which we honor where applicable.</p>

                    <h2>10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
