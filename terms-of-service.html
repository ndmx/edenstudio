                        <p>Welcome to Park Memories! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Park Memories mobile application ("App") and our website (collectively, the "Services"), operated by Alexander Ukaga ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, or accessing the website, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>

                        <p>Park Memories is a family-focused app for capturing, editing, and sharing photos with filters, captions, location tags, and private family feeds. It uses Firebase for secure data handling.</p>

                        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
                        <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use the Services. If you are under 18, you must have parental consent. By using the Services, you represent that you meet these requirements and have the authority to agree to these Terms.</p>

                        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
                        <p>To access full features, you must create an account with a valid email and password. You agree to provide accurate information and keep your account secure. We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations. You are responsible for all activity on your account.</p>

                        <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
                        <p>You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes. Prohibited activities include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uploading harmful, illegal, or infringing content (e.g., copyrighted photos without permission).</li>
                            <li>Harassing, threatening, or impersonating others.</li>
                            <li>Sharing explicit or inappropriate material, especially involving children.</li>
                            <li>Reverse-engineering the App or circumventing security features.</li>
                            <li>Using the Services for commercial purposes without our consent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We may remove content or terminate access for violations.</p>

                        <h2>4. Content Ownership and License</h2>
                        <p>You retain ownership of your User Content (photos, captions, etc.). By uploading, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, display, and distribute it within the Services (e.g., family feeds). We do not claim ownership but reserve rights to moderate or remove content.</p>

                        <p>We own all rights to the App's design, code, and features. You may not copy or distribute them.</p>

                        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                        <p>The App integrates Google Firebase for authentication, storage, and databases. Your use is subject to Google's terms. We do not control third-party sites; their privacy practices differ.</p>

                        <h2>6. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
                        <p>Park Memories is free, with optional in-app purchases (e.g., premium filters). All payments are processed via Apple In-App Purchase. You agree to Apple's payment terms. Refunds are handled by Apple; contact support for issues.</p>

                        <h2>7. Disclaimers and Liability</h2>
                        <p>The Services are provided "as is" without warranties. We disclaim liability for interruptions, data loss, or indirect damages. Our total liability is limited to $100 or fees paid in the past 12 months.</p>

                        <p>You indemnify us against claims arising from your use or content.</p>

                        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
                        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access for violations, with or without notice. Upon termination, your license ends; we may retain data for legal reasons.</p>

                        <h2>9. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
                        <p>These Terms are governed by Pennsylvania law. Disputes will be resolved in Philadelphia courts. For EU users, GDPR applies.</p>

                        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
                        <p>We may update these Terms; continued use constitutes acceptance. We'll notify via App or email for material changes.</p>

                        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
